		<p>
		Christmas gift interest is a totally real rule of Christmas that states, when a desired gift is not   given by Christmas Day, interest begins to compound daily at rate of 100%. Example: someone wants to spend 2 hours with Erin, if that is not met by Christmas day of that year, as of the 26th the time owed would be an additional 2 hours, the interest continues to compund until the gift is given.
